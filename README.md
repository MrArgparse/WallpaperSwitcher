# WallpaperSwitcher
Set wallpapers from a folder on-the-fly with hotkeys.

This AutoHotkey script will allow you to change wallpapers on the fly by using keyboard shortcuts. Feel free to modify and recompile it to suit your needs.

The default behavior is to use CTRL+ALT+LEFT to cycle forwards and CTRL+ALT+RIGHT to cycle backwards.

One can also modify the script to:

- Change The shortcut

- Use a 2nd folder with different shortcuts

- Set a random wallpaper

- Change wallpapers on a time based apporach
